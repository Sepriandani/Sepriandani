### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dimas.

An independent Software Engineer who loves to create and share projects about the web, machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT)! 

I'm currently active in contributing as an Academy Code Reviewer at <a href="https://github.com/dicodingacademy">@dicodingacademy</a> to review student submissions (assignments) and collaborate with the Academy team in designing submissions (assignments).
